# Silver Tsunami and SQL
## Overview of Project

### Purpose
Pewlett Hackard, a large company, wants to prepare for the expected “silver tsunami” of baby-boomers retiring. Bobby and I provide them with an analysis of their employees to determine who will be retiring from the company and how many employees will be leaving. They have now asked for retiring employees by title and identify those who can participate in their mentorship program to train new employees. 

## Results and Analysis
### The Number of Retiring Employees by Title
- There are 75,458 employees set to retire. The company has a total of 300,024 employees.
- The largest group of employees that will retire are 25,916 Senior Engineers. 
- While there are only 2 managers leaving – the other table of managers show that is already a shortage of managers. There are 9 departments, 7 of which have managers, and 2 of those will be retiring. This will leave only 5 managers for 9 departments until more are hired or promoted through the company.

## Summary
### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact? 
The number of employees set to retire soon is quite large, almost a 4th of the company. While they still have these employees, it would be wise to cross train and even promote some of the lower tiered jobs into the senior positions so that new employees can begin to fill in those positions as well. Another item that should be given attention to is the management. There are currently 7 managers over 9 departments. Which seems to be a stretch. To dilute that even further once 2 retire; 5 managers for 9 departments might cause serious issues. 

### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees? 
There are 1,940 eligible employees that could participate in the Mentorship Program. While it doesn’t seem like a lot; the timing
